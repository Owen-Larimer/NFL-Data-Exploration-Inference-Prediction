# NFL-Data-Exploration-Inference-Prediction

### Project Overview

A project dedicated to taking in NFL data, cleaning it, exploring it, and drawing conclusions and predictions from it.

### Data Sources

Player Data: The main data source used for this project was the dataset was the file "players.csv" taken from [this kaggle page.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aryashah2k/beginners-sports-analytics-nfl-dataset?select=players.csv)
